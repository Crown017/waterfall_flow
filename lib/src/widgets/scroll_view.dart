/// A scrollable, 2D array of widgets are laid out in masonry layout.
///
/// It looks like [GridView] whose children have the fixed cross-axis size,
/// the differences are the main-axis size are variable.
/// A contiguous sequence of children are laid out after the shortest
/// one of the previous row/columnã€‚
///
/// The main axis direction of a grid is the direction in which it scrolls (the
/// [scrollDirection]).
///
/// The most commonly used masonry layout are [MasonryGridView.count], which creates a
/// layout with a fixed number of tiles in the cross axis.
///
/// To create a masonry layout with a large (or infinite) number of children, use the
/// [MasonryGridView.builder] constructor either a
/// [SliverMasonryGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount] or a
/// [SliverMasonryGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent] for the [gridDelegate].
///
/// To use a custom [SliverMasonryGridDelegate], use [MasonryGridView.custom].
///
/// To create a linear array of children, use a [ListView].
///
/// To control the initial scroll offset of the scroll view, provide a
/// [controller] with its [ScrollController.initialScrollOffset] property set.
///
/// ## Transitioning to [CustomScrollView]
///
/// A [MasonryGridView] is basically a [CustomScrollView] with a single [SliverMasonryGrid] in
/// its [CustomScrollView.slivers] property.
///
/// If [MasonryGridView] is no longer sufficient, for example because the scroll view
/// is to have both a grid and a list, or because the grid is to be combined
/// with a [SliverAppBar], etc, it is straight-forward to port code from using
/// [MasonryGridView] to using [CustomScrollView] directly.
///
/// The [key], [scrollDirection], [reverse], [controller], [primary], [physics],
/// and [shrinkWrap] properties on [MasonryGridView] map directly to the identically
/// named properties on [CustomScrollView].
///
/// The [CustomScrollView.slivers] property should be a list containing just a
/// [SliverMasonryGrid].
///
/// The [childrenDelegate] property on [MasonryGridView] corresponds to the
/// [SliverMasonryGrid.childrenDelegate] property, and the [gridDelegate] property on the
/// [MasonryGridView] corresponds to the [SliverMasonryGrid.gridDelegate] property.
///
/// The [MasonryGridView], [MasonryGridView.count] and [MasonryGridView.extent] constructors'
/// `children` arguments correspond to the [childrenDelegate] being a [SliverChildListDelegate]
/// with that same argument.
/// The [MasonryGridView.builder] constructor's `itemBuilder` and `childCount` arguments
/// correspond to the [childrenDelegate] being a [SliverChildBuilderDelegate]
/// with the matching arguments.
///
/// The [MasonryGridView.count] and [GridMasonryGridViewView.extent] constructors create
/// custom grid delegates, and have equivalently named constructors on
/// [SliverMasonryGrid] to ease the transition: [SliverMasonryGrid.count] and
/// [SliverMasonryGrid.extent] respectively.
///
/// The [padding] property corresponds to having a [SliverPadding] in the
/// [CustomScrollView.slivers] property instead of the grid itself, and having
/// the [SliverMasonryGrid] instead be a child of the [SliverPadding].
///
/// By default, [ListView] will automatically pad the list's scrollable
/// extremities to avoid partial obstructions indicated by [MediaQuery]'s
/// padding. To avoid this behavior, override with a zero [padding] property.
///
/// Once code has been ported to use [CustomScrollView], other slivers, such as
/// [SliverList] or [SliverAppBar], can be put in the [CustomScrollView.slivers]
/// list.
///
/// {@tool snippet}
/// This example demonstrates how to create a [MasonryGridView] with two columns. The
/// children are spaced apart using the [crossAxisSpacing] and [mainAxisSpacing]
/// properties.
